## Scroll Animations

## Introduction

This project was created to explore scroll-based animations, similar to the ones used by [Apple](https://www.apple.com/br/airpods-3rd-generation/). 

The animations are based on [Scroll Sequence](https://scrollsequence.com/). I used a small script (downloader.html file) to download all the frames. This code can be quite useful for downloading data from an array of URLs.
