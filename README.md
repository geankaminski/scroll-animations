## Scroll Animations

## Introduction

Project created to delve a little deeper into scroll-based animations like the ones [Apple](https://www.apple.com/br/airpods-3rd-generation/) loves.

The animations are based on [Scroll Sequence](https://scrollsequence.com/). I used a small script (downloader.html file) to download all the frames. This little code can be very useful for downloading data from an array of urls.

I still need to deal with all the responsive part of the project but that's for another time.

Thanks to [CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/lets-make-one-of-those-fancy-scrolling-animations-used-on-apple-product-pages/) for clarifying my ideas about these spells.
